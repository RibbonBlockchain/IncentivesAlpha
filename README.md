Ribbon Blockchain is a healthcare incentives platform that aims to modify health and wellness behaviour through rewardable tasks.

Ribbon channels donated, pledged or sponsored funding directly to patients, community health workers and healthcare practitioners; where such funding is used to incentivize preventative care, adherence to medication and therapy, quality of care delivery and overall population health outcomes.

Our Incentives are distributed in DAI, an asset-backed, decentralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain.
